"""Puzzle explanation: https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/21"""

I solved this one on paper. Since the boss has 9 more hitpoints than I do, I need
to do more damage per turn than him. He has a total of 10 stats. To do more damage
I need a total of 11 stats. To pay the least I need to buy the most cost efficient
items per stat. After looking through the weapons the most cost efficient one is
the longsword (40 gold, 7 stats). Looking through the armour the most cost efficient
is the chainmail (31 cost, 2 stats). After that it's more cost effective to buy Rings
specifically, the defense +2 ring (40 cost, 2 stats). This all adds up to a total of
(111 gold, 11 stats)

111 gold is my puzzle answer for part 1

For part two I need to buy as much as possible and still lose. This probably means
I need 10 stats. Now I do the opposite of part 1 and look for the least cost effective
equipment. Since I need a weapon, I'll get the one with the least stats, since weapons
are too cost effective: dagger (8 cost, 4 stats). Then i'll skip to rings since they are
the least cost effective weapon type: damage +3 (100 cost, 3 stats), armour + 3 (80 cost, 3 stats)
This adds up to a total of:  (188 gold, 10 stats)

188 gold is my puzzle answer for part 2
